# MICD

Look, I want to say I'm doing a clone of minecraft using three.js and react, but we both know it's not gonna happen.

So here is just a playground with minecraft in mind just so I toy around with things I've never done before.

Demo is available here:

If you want to run it as a desktop app:

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```
