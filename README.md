# MICD

Look, I want to say I'm doing a clone of minecraft using three.js and react, but we both know it's not gonna happen.

So here is just a playground with minecraft in mind just so I toy around with things I've never done before.

Demo is available here:

If you want to run it as a desktop app:

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```

## TODO

I'm taking it one step at a time. So for now:

### immediate improvements

-   Better brick system, more generic. Load all textures and pick and choose base off of a config file of some sort
-   textures really don't need to be that big, 8 bits png would do the trick and probably would lighten everything up

### long term milestones

-   display a couple of bricks together
-   camera controlled by keyboard
-   generate a terrain
-   concept of chunks?
-   physics
-   crafting?
